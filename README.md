```css

The Magic is in these key properties:
- perspective: 1000px - Creates a 3D viewing context (like setting up a camera distance)
- transform-style: preserve-3d - Allows child elements to exist in 3D space
- transform: rotateY(180deg) - Rotates the card 180 degrees around the Y-axis on hover
- transition: transform 0.6s - Smoothly animates the rotation over 0.6 seconds

The concept: A 3D card that rotates in space when hovered, revealing the back side. No JavaScript needed because CSS handles the hover state and 3D transforms natively. */

/*

3D Space Setup: perspective creates a 3D viewing context - imagine you're looking at the card from a certain distance

The Flip Mechanism: The hover pseudo-class triggers a Y-axis rotation of 180 degrees

Backface Management: The back card is pre-rotated 180 degrees so when the container flips, it appears normal

Smooth Animation: The transition property makes it animate smoothly instead of snapping instantly. */

# Timeline
```css
/*
- **Center Line:** `::after` pseudo-element creates the vertical timeline
- **Alternating Layout:** `nth-child(odd)` goes left, `nth-child(even)` goes right
- **Circular Markers:** Another `::after` pseudo-element for the dots
- **Responsive Positioning:** Items are 50% width, positioned at 0% or 50%
- Creates the vertical timeline structure
- Positions items alternately left and right using `nth-child`
- Adds the center line and circular markers with `::after` pseudo-elements
- Handles responsive design

**JavaScript Adds Polish:**

- Detects when timeline items scroll into view
- Triggers smooth fade-in animations
- Enhances user experience but isn't required for functionality

- **Separation of Concerns:** CSS handles layout, JS handles behavior
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Works without JS, better with JS
- **Pseudo-elements:** Powerful for decorative elements like lines and dots
- **Viewport Detection:** `getBoundingClientRect()` is the standard way to detect element visibility*/
```

# Increasing numbers
```css
/* ### ðŸŽ¯ **Core Animation Concept**

- **Mathematical Progression:** `current += (target / duration) * interval`
- **Visual Feedback:** Numbers counting up feels more engaging than instant display
- **Timing Control:** 2000ms duration with 10ms intervals = 200 steps

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

1. **Data Storage:** HTML `data-target` attributes store final values
2. **Viewport Detection:** `getBoundingClientRect()` determines visibility
3. **Animation Loop:** `setInterval` creates smooth incremental updates
4. **Cleanup:** `clearInterval` prevents memory leaks

### ðŸ“± **User Experience Considerations**

- **Progressive Enhancement:** Works without JS, enhanced with JS
- **Performance:** Only animates visible elements
- **Accessibility:** Final numbers remain readable if animation fails
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Cards animate first, then counters

### ðŸŽ¨ **Why This Pattern is Effective**

- **Attention Grabbing:** Moving numbers draw user focus
- - **Data Visualization:** Makes abstract numbers feel more concrete
- **Engagement:** Users tend to watch the full animation
- **Scalable:** Same code works for any number of statistics

### ðŸš€ **Advanced Concepts**

- **Intersection Observer API:** Modern alternative to scroll events
- **CSS Custom Properties:** Could store animation duration in CSS
- **Animation Easing:** Could add easing functions for more natural motion

# Principal Cards

### **1. Overview & Purpose**

"This is an interactive principles gallery that teaches the '5 Rs of Zero Waste' through an engaging, clickable interface. Instead of presenting static information, users can actively explore each principle by clicking on icons or using arrow navigation."

### **2. Key Components Breakdown**

#### **HTML Structure (What You See)**

- **Gallery Navigation**: 5 circular icons representing each principle (Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Rot)
- **Arrow Controls**: Left/right arrows for sequential navigation
- **Content Viewer**: Dynamic content area that displays detailed information about the selected principle

#### **CSS Styling (How It Looks)**

- **Visual Hierarchy**: Active items are highlighted with opacity changes, scaling effects, and glowing borders
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes with mobile-friendly layouts
- **Smooth Animations**: Includes fade-in effects, pulsing animations, and hover states

#### **JavaScript Functionality (How It Works)**

- **Event Listeners**: Responds to clicks on gallery items and arrow buttons
- **State Management**: Tracks which principle is currently active
- **Dynamic Content Switching**: Shows/hides content cards based on user selection

### **3. Interactive Features Tour**

#### **Feature 1: Click Navigation**

"Users can click on any of the 5 principle icons. Notice how the selected icon gets a glowing green border with a pulsing animation, while others fade to 50% opacity. This provides clear visual feedback about what's currently selected."

#### **Feature 2: Arrow Navigation**

"The left and right arrows allow users to cycle through principles sequentially. The navigation is circular - clicking 'next' on the last item takes you to the first, and vice versa."

#### **Feature 3: Smooth Transitions**

"When switching between principles, the content fades in smoothly with a subtle slide-up animation. This creates a polished, professional feel."

#### **Feature 4: Auto-Scrolling**

"On mobile devices, when you use arrow navigation, the gallery automatically scrolls to center the active item in view."

### **4. Technical Implementation Highlights**

#### **Data Attributes**

```html
<div class="gallery-item" data-card="refuse-card">
```

"Each gallery item uses a `data-card` attribute that corresponds to the ID of its content card. This creates a clean connection between navigation and content."

#### **State Management**

```javascript
// Remove active class from all items
principleCards.forEach(card => card.classList.remove('active'));
// Add active class to selected item
document.getElementById(cardId).classList.add('active');
```

"The JavaScript manages the 'active' state by removing the active class from all items, then adding it only to the selected one."

#### **Circular Navigation Logic**

```javascript
if (direction === 'next') {
    nextItem = activeItem.nextElementSibling;
    if (!nextItem) {
        nextItem = document.querySelector('.gallery-item:first-child');
    }
}
```

"The arrow navigation includes logic to wrap around - when you reach the end, it automatically goes to the beginning."

### **5. User Experience Benefits**

1. **Engagement**: Interactive elements keep users engaged rather than passive reading
2. **Clear Feedback**: Visual cues (glowing, scaling, fading) show exactly what's selected
3. **Multiple Navigation Methods**: Users can click directly on items or use arrows
4. **Responsive**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
5. **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation support and semantic HTML structure

### **6. Design Patterns Used**

- **Card-Based Layout**: Information is organized in digestible cards
- **Gallery Pattern**: Familiar horizontal scrolling gallery interface
- **State Visualization**: Clear active/inactive states
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works even if JavaScript fails

### **7. Performance Considerations**

- **Efficient DOM Queries**: Elements are selected once and reused
- **CSS Animations**: Hardware-accelerated transforms for smooth performance
- **Event Delegation**: Minimal event listeners for optimal performance

This implementation demonstrates how to create an engaging, educational interface that transforms static content into an interactive learning experience. The combination of intuitive navigation, clear visual feedback, and smooth animations creates a professional, user-friendly component that effectively communicates the zero-waste principles.

# Wave and leaves

The `<header>` acts as a hero section. Iâ€™ve added 12 floating `leaf` divs and 3 layered `wave` divs inside a `.wave-container`. This forms a moving, animated, nature-inspired background
The header uses a semi-transparent white background with a blur effect using `backdrop-filter` for a soft glassmorphism style. Itâ€™s centered and padded for visual breathing room
Each `.wave` is a semi-transparent, overflowing div with a curved bottom. The `@keyframes wave` animation shifts it horizontally and scales its Y-axis for a fluid, ocean-like motion. They layer with different delays and opacities for depth.
Each `.leaf` is a small, organic shape using custom border-radius. They float using the `@keyframes floating` animation which vertically bobs and rotates them, mimicking leaves dancing in the air
The JavaScript script randomizes the size, opacity, color, and animation speed of each leaf. This adds natural variation so they donâ€™t look repetitive. Iâ€™m simulating how nature is never uniform.
I included an Intersection Observer to reveal sections smoothly on scroll, and optionally animate cards when they come into view â€” adding a layer of interactivity."
